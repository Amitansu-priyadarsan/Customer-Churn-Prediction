Here’s a **README.md** file template that you can use for your GitHub repository for the **Customer Churn Prediction** project. I've included all the essential sections, along with instructions for dataset usage.

## Customer Churn Prediction

### Project Overview
This project predicts customer churn (whether a customer will stop using a service) using machine learning models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest. The dataset used is from a telecommunications company, and it includes features like customer demographics, contract details, payment methods, and other relevant information.

The final goal is to create a model that can accurately predict whether a customer will churn based on the provided data.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is called **Telco Customer Churn**, and it includes the following columns:

- **customerID**: Unique identifier for each customer (not used for prediction)
- **gender**: Male or Female
- **SeniorCitizen**: Whether the customer is a senior citizen (binary: 0 or 1)
- **Partner**: Whether the customer has a partner
- **Dependents**: Whether the customer has dependents
- **tenure**: The number of months the customer has been with the company
- **PhoneService**: Whether the customer has phone service
- **MultipleLines**: Whether the customer has multiple lines
- **InternetService**: Customer’s internet service provider (DSL, Fiber optic, or None)
- **OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, TechSupport, StreamingTV, StreamingMovies**: Whether the customer has these services
- **Contract**: Customer's contract type (Month-to-month, One year, Two year)
- **PaperlessBilling**: Whether the customer uses paperless billing
- **PaymentMethod**: Customer's payment method (Electronic check, Mailed check, etc.)
- **MonthlyCharges**: The monthly amount charged to the customer
- **TotalCharges**: Total amount charged to the customer
- **Churn**: The target variable (Yes = customer churned, No = customer did not churn)

  ### Dataset Source

The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle. You can find it here:
[Telco Customer Churn Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)


### Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-churn-prediction.git
   cd customer-churn-prediction
   ```

2. **Install required libraries:**
   To run the project, install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```



### Usage
1. Open `churn_prediction.ipynb` in Google Colab or any Jupyter Notebook environment.
2. Run the notebook step by step to:
   - Load and clean the dataset
   - Preprocess the data (encoding categorical variables, handling missing values)
   - Train machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
   - Tune hyperparameters with GridSearchCV
   - Visualize feature importance

3. Results of the predictions will be printed in the notebook, including:
   - Accuracy
   - Confusion matrix
   - Classification report
   - Feature importance plot

### Models Used
- **Logistic Regression**: A baseline model for binary classification.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that typically provides better accuracy than Logistic Regression.
- **GridSearchCV**: For hyperparameter tuning of the Random Forest model.

### Key Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Measures the proportion of correctly classified instances.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Shows the performance of the classification algorithm in terms of True Positives, False Positives, False Negatives, and True Negatives.
- **Precision, Recall, F1-score**: Additional metrics for model evaluation, focusing on the balance between precision and recall.

### Sample Outputs

- **Logistic Regression Accuracy**: ~80-82%
- **Random Forest Accuracy**: ~82-85%
- **Confusion Matrix**: Performance on test data, breaking down correct and incorrect predictions.
- **Feature Importance**: Shows which features (e.g., MonthlyCharges, tenure, Contract type) contribute most to predicting churn.
